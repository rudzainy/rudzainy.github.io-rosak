While designing a flight booking app, I needed to find resources for flipboards similar to the ones used in airports. The only one I could find only had flip-down numbers, so I decided to create my own.

I started by adding alphabet characters and a few other symbols to the existing flipboard design. I used the same font family as the numbers too maintain design consistency. Once I was satisfied with the results, I republished the flipboard and made it available to other designers.
