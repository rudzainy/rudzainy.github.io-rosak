A colleague of mine asked me to design a logo for his personal web development solutions company. 

This design was rejected, however I have always liked the symbolism behind the combination of asterisk (*) and the letter A. 

I wanted to illustrate how the company 

- considers multiple solutions to a problem and always proceed to selecting the best fit for clients (the asterisk is divided into three arrows pointing inwards)
