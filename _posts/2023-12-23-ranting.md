Ranting is a link-in-bio platform that allows any Malaysian creators to showcase their work and social media profiles in a single, easy-to-share link. 
      
It is a platform that allows creators to add links to their website, blog, social media profiles, email address, and other online assets. It can be customized with a variety of colors, fonts, and images. Ranting is free to use for 30 days, and there are paid plans available for creators who need more features.
Here are some of the features that make Ranting a good option for Malaysian creators:
<ul>
  <li>Personal dashboard for anything you need.</li>
  <li>It supports the use of Malaysian e-Wallets.</li>
  <li>It is designed with Malaysian creators in mind, so it is easy to use and navigate.</li>
  <li>It is a reliable and secure platform.</li>
</ul>

It's still work in progress. Do check out the alpha build [here](https://ranting-mvp.onrender.com) and let me know what you think ðŸ˜€âœ¨
