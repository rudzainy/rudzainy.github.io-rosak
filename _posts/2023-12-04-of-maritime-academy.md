Title: Building a Maritime Academy: A Journey of Growth and Development

Introduction:

From September 2009 to July 2012, I had the opportunity to work as an HRA/Business Development Executive/Teaching Assistant at the Maritime Education & Training Academy (META), located within the Maritime College (MARCO) in Selangor, Malaysia. During this period, I was part of a dedicated team that embarked on an exciting mission to establish a maritime academy in Seri Manjung, Perak, and Rawang, Selangor. This article delves into my experiences and the significant responsibilities I undertook during this time, including curriculum development, liaising with government authorities, managing day-to-day operations, and utilizing ship simulators as educational tools.

Building the Academy: A Collaborative Effort

Creating a maritime academy from scratch was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. As a member of the team, we worked diligently to lay the foundation of the academy and shape its future. Our primary objective was to establish training programs that would prepare aspiring seafarers for the dynamic and demanding maritime industry.

Curriculum Development: Nurturing Seamanship Skills

One of my key responsibilities was to develop the syllabus for the basic seamanship program. This involved carefully structuring the course content to ensure comprehensive coverage of essential skills and knowledge required for a successful maritime career. Collaborating with experienced industry professionals, we created a curriculum that encompassed topics such as navigation, first aid, vessel operations, safety procedures, and maritime regulations. We also collaborated with the Fire Department

Liaising with Marine Department of Malaysia: Accreditation and Reporting

Ensuring the academy's programs met the necessary standards and received proper accreditation was crucial. In close collaboration with officials from the Marine Department of Malaysia, I facilitated the accreditation process, ensuring compliance with regulatory guidelines. Regular communication with the authorities included reporting on student progress, course evaluations, and other official matters.

Managing Day-to-Day Operations: Smooth Functioning of the Academy

Efficient management of the academy's day-to-day operations was essential for its smooth functioning. Overseeing administrative tasks, coordinating schedules, and handling logistical arrangements became integral aspects of my role. By creating streamlined processes and maintaining a conducive learning environment, we aimed to provide students with the best possible educational experience.

Supervising and Coordinating Student Activities: Fostering Growth and Engagement

As a teaching assistant, I had the privilege of working closely with students. I took on the responsibility of supervising and coordinating their activities, encouraging their participation in extracurricular events and fostering a sense of camaraderie among them. By organizing seminars, workshops, and team-building exercises, we aimed to cultivate holistic growth and enhance their overall learning experience.

Utilizing Ship Simulators: Bridging Theory and Practice

One of the most innovative tools we employed to enhance the learning process was the use of ship simulators. These simulators allowed students to gain practical knowledge by virtually exploring different types of vessels and understanding their layouts. As a teaching assistant, I assisted lecturers in conducting virtual walkthroughs, enabling students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the maritime industry.

Conclusion:

The years spent as an HRA/Business Development Executive/Teaching Assistant at META and MARCO were transformative and enriching. Working in a dedicated team, we played a vital role in establishing a maritime academy that aimed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the industry. From curriculum development and liaising with government officials to managing day-to-day operations and utilizing ship simulators, each responsibility contributed to the growth and success of the academy. This experience not only shaped my professional journey but also highlighted the importance of collaboration, innovation, and dedication in the field of maritime education.
