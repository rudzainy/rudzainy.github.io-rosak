Well, language is definately *NOT* my fortÃ©...

I like computers though. So typing on the keyboard has long become a path for me to start writing. Coding helps as well. I started going public in the early social media days on platforms such as Friendster, DeviantArt, [my first blog](https://rudzainy.blogspot.com) and eventually ended up with *you* reading this here right now ðŸ«°.
